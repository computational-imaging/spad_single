** Existing MDEs suffer from scale invariant error.
** Stereo methods are better, but still lacking (occlusions)
** Scanning LiDAR is bulky and expensive
** Combine the best of both worlds
* Key insight: resolve scale-invariant error with a single pixel flash LiDAR
** Able to timestamp returning photons with picosecond accuracy
* Method
** RGB pipeline first
*** 
** Accumulate photons into a histogram of image depths
** Estimate an intensity image
