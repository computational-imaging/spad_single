short summary

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
	\item laser power vs range tradeoff; may be limited to short--medium range
	\item if the monocular depth estimation fails, so will the histogram matching 
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
	\item miniaturize system
	\item ...
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item new depth estimation CNNs achieve marginal gains, let's think about computational photography approaches that augment the measurements to achieve better performance
